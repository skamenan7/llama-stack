Welcome to our blog!

We're excited to introduce you to **Llama Stack** - the open-source platform that simplifies building production-ready generative AI applications.

<!--truncate-->

## What is Llama Stack?

Llama Stack defines and standardizes the core building blocks needed to bring generative AI applications to market, centered on the [Open Responses specification](https://www.openresponses.org/). By aligning with OpenAI’s open-sourced Responses API, Llama Stack provides a consistent, interoperable foundation for building agentic and generative systems. It offers a growing suite of open-source APIs—including prompts, conversations, files, models, embeddings, fine-tuning, and MCP—enabling seamless transitions from local development to production across providers and environments.

Think of Llama Stack as a universal interface that abstracts away the complexity of working with different AI tools and provider (e.g., vector databases, model inference providers, and deployment environments). Whether you're building locally, deploying on-premises, or scaling in the cloud, Llama Stack provides a consistent developer experience.

## Key Features

### Unified API Layer

Llama Stack provides standardized APIs across six core capabilities:

- **Inference**: Run models locally or in the cloud with a consistent interface
- **Vector Stores**: Build knowledge and agentic retrieval systems
- **Agents**: Create intelligent agent flows with responses/conversations
- **Tools and MCP**: Integrate with external tools and services directly or via MCP
- **Moderations**: Built-in safety guardrails and content filtering via moderations api

### Plugin Architecture

The plugin architecture supports a rich ecosystem of API implementations across different environments:

- **Local Development**: Start with CPU-only setups for rapid iteration
- **On-Premises**: Deploy in your own infrastructure
- **Cloud**: Scale with hosted providers

### Prepackaged Distributions

Distributions are pre-configured bundles of provider implementations that make it easy to get started. You can begin with a local setup using Ollama and seamlessly transition to production with vLLM - all without changing your application code.

### Multiple Developer Interfaces

Llama Stack supports various developer interfaces:

- **CLI**: Command-line tools for server management
- **Python SDK**: [`llama-stack-client-python`](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack-client-python)
- **TypeScript SDK**: [`llama-stack-client-typescript`](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack-client-typescript)

## Why Llama Stack?

### Flexibility Without Compromise

Developers can choose their preferred infrastructure without changing APIs. This means you can:

- Start locally for development
- Test with different providers
- Deploy to production with your chosen infrastructure
- Switch providers as your needs evolve

All while maintaining the same codebase and APIs.

### Consistent Experience

With unified APIs, Llama Stack makes it easier to:

- Build applications with consistent behavior
- Test across different environments
- Deploy with confidence
- Maintain and update your codebase

### Robust Ecosystem

Llama Stack integrates with distribution partners including:

- **Cloud Providers**: AWS Bedrock, Together, Fireworks, and more
- **Hardware Vendors**: NVIDIA, Cerebras, SambaNova
- **Vector Databases**: ChromaDB, Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch
- **AI Companies**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini

For a complete list, check out our [Providers Documentation](/docs/providers).

## How It Works

Llama Stack consists of two main components:

1. **Server**: A server with pluggable API providers that can run in various environments
2. **Client SDKs**: Libraries for your applications to interact with the server

The server handles all the complexity of managing different providers, while the client SDKs provide a simple, consistent interface for your application code.

Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://llamastack.github.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart) to get started building your first AI application with Llama Stack.

## What's Next?
