## Issues

This document outlines known limitations and inconsistencies between Llama Stack's Responses API and OpenAI's Responses API. This comparison is based on OpenAI's API and reflects a comparison with the OpenAI APIs as of October 6, 2025 (OpenAI's client version `openai==1.107`).
See the OpenAI [changelog](https://platform.openai.com/docs/changelog) for details of any new functionality that has been added since that date. Links to issues are included so readers can read about status, post comments, and/or subscribe for updates relating to any limitations that are of specific interest to them. We would also love any other feedback on any use-cases you try that do not work to help prioritize the pieces left to implement.
Please open new issues in the [meta-llama/llama-stack](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack) GitHub repository with details of anything that does not work that does not already have an open issue.

### Web-search tool compatibility

**Status:** Partial Implementation

**Issue:** https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/4442

Llama Stack offers an OpenAI compatible Web Search tool. To have a feature complete implementation of Web Search that is compatible with what OpenAI's tool offers, the following features need to be implemented:

- [ ] Domain filtering: Restrict searching to a whitelisted subset of domains
- [ ] User location: Refine search results based on geography by specifying an approximate user location using country, city, region, and/or timezone
- [ ] Live internet access: Control whether the web search tool fetches live content or uses only cached/indexed results in the Responses API

---

## Implement Remaining Include flags

**Status:** Partially Implemented

**Issue:** https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/4440

OpenAI allows you to return an optional subset of additional/power user data in their API response.
Llama Stack's API now supports these fields, but most of them are not implemented. Not all of them will
make sense to implement in llama stack, but this meta issue tracks which of them are implemented and which are not.

- [ ] `web_search_call.action.sources`
- [ ] `code_interpreter_call.outputs`
- [ ] `computer_call_output.output.image_url`
- [ ] `file_search_call.results`
- [ ] `message.input_image.image_url`
- [ ] `message.output_text.logprobs`
- [ ] `reasoning.encrypted_content`
- [x] `message.output_text.logprobs`

---

### Reasoning Content

**Status:** Not Implemented

**Issue:** [#4404](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/4404)

Responses API allows you to preserve reasoning context between turns with the reasoning.encrypted_content include value.
The field exists as a no-op right now, and needs to be wired up to providers.

---

### Other built-in Tools

**Status:** Partial Implementation

OpenAI's Responses API includes an ecosystem of built-in tools (e.g., code interpreter) that lower the barrier to entry for agentic workflows. These tools are typically aligned with specific model training.

**Current Status in Llama Stack:**
- Some built-in tools exist (file search, web search)
- Missing tools include code interpreter, computer use, and image generation
- Some built-in tools may require additional APIs (e.g., [containers API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/containers) for code interpreter)

It's unclear whether there is demand for additional built-in tools in Llama Stack. No upstream issues have been filed for adding more built-in tools.

---

### Response Branching

**Status:** Not Working

Response branching, as discussed in the [Agents vs OpenAI Responses API documentation](https://llamastack.github.io/docs/building_applications/responses_vs_agents), is not currently functional.

---

### Safety Identification and Tracking

**Status:** Not Implemented

**Issue:** [#4381](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/4381)

OpenAI's platform allows users to track agentic users using a safety identifier passed with each response. When requests violate moderation or safety rules, account holders are alerted and automated actions can be taken. This capability is not currently available in Llama Stack.

---

### Reasoning

**Status:** Partially Implemented

The `reasoning` object in the output of Responses works for inference providers such as vLLM that output reasoning traces in chat completions requests.  It does not work for other providers such as OpenAI's hosted service.  See [#3551](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3551) for more details.

---

### Service Tier

**Status:** Not Implemented

**Issue:** [#3550](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3550)

Responses has a field `service_tier` that can be used to prioritize access to inference resources.  Not all inference providers have such a concept, but Llama Stack pass through this value for those providers that do.  Currently it does not.

---

### Max Output Tokens

**Status:** Not Implemented

**Issue:** [#3562](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3562)

The `max_output_tokens` field limits how many tokens the model is allowed to generate (for both reasoning and output combined).  It is not implemented in Llama Stack.

---

### Incomplete Details

**Status:** Not Implemented

**Issue:** [#3567](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3567)

The return object from a call to Responses includes a field for indicating why a response is incomplete if it is.  For example, if the model stops generating because it has reached the specified max output tokens (see above), this field should be set to "IncompleteDetails(reason='max_output_tokens')".  This is not implemented in Llama Stack.

---

### Background

**Status:** Not Implemented

**Issue:** [#3568](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3568)

[Background mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background) in OpenAI Responses lets you start a response generation job and then check back in on it later.  This is useful if you might lose a connection during a generation and want to reconnect later and get the response back (for example if the client is running in a mobile app).  It is not implemented in Llama Stack.

---

### Global Guardrails

**Status:** Feature Request

When calling the OpenAI Responses API, model outputs go through safety models configured by OpenAI administrators. Perhaps Llama Stack should provide a mechanism to configure safety models (or non-model logic) for all Responses requests, either through `config.yaml` or an administrative API.

---

### User-Controlled Guardrails

**Status:** Feature Request

**Issue:** [#3325](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3325)

OpenAI has not released a way for users to configure their own guardrails. However, Llama Stack users may want this capability to complement or replace global guardrails. This could be implemented as a non-breaking, additive difference from the OpenAI API.

---

### MCP Elicitations

**Status:** Unknown

Elicitations allow MCP servers to request additional information from users through the client during interactions (e.g., a tool requesting a username before proceeding).
See the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/client/elicitation) for details.

**Open Questions:**
- Does this work in OpenAI's Responses API reference implementation?
- If not, is there a reasonable way to make that work within the API as is? Or would the API need to change?
- Does this work in Llama Stack?

---

### MCP Sampling

**Status:** Unknown

Sampling allows MCP tools to query the generative AI model. See the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/client/sampling) for details.

**Open Questions:**
- Does this work in OpenAI's Responses API reference implementation?
- If not, is there a reasonable way to make that work within the API as is? Or would the API need to change?
- Does this work in Llama Stack?

---

### Prompt Caching

**Status:** Unknown

OpenAI provides a [prompt caching](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching) mechanism in Responses that is enabled for its most recent models.

**Open Questions:**
- Does this work in Llama Stack?
- If not, is there a reasonable way to make that work for those inference providers that have this capability by passing through the provided `prompt_cache_key` to the inference provider?
- Is there a reasonable way to make that work for inference providers that don't build in this capability by doing some sort of caching at the Llama Stack layer?

---

## Coming Soon

### Parallel Tool Calls

**Status:** In Progress

Align Llama Stack Responses Paralell tool calls behavior with OpenAI and harden the implementation with tests.

---

### Connectors

**Status:** In Progress

**Issue:** [#4061](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/4061)

Connectors are MCP servers maintained and managed by the Responses API provider. OpenAI has documented their connectors at [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).

**Open Questions:**
- Should Llama Stack include built-in support for some, all, or none of OpenAI's connectors?
- Should there be a mechanism for administrators to add custom connectors via `config.yaml` or an API?

---

### Top Logprobs

**Status:** In Progress

**Issue:** [#3552](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3552)

The `top_logprobs` parameter from OpenAI's Responses API extends the functionality obtained by including `message.output_text.logprobs` in the `include` parameter list (as discussed in the Include section above).
It enables users to also get logprobs for alternative tokens.

---

### Web Search API Arguments

**Status:** Merged [Planed 0.4.z]

**Issue:** https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/4102

 Llama Stack supports `web_search`, `web_search_preview`, `web_search_preview_2025_03_1`, and now `web_search_2025_08_26` for
 the built in web search tool.

---

### Server Side Telemetry

**Status:** Merged [Planned 0.4.z]

**Issue:** [#3806](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3806)

Support OpenTelemetry as the preferred way to instrument Llama Stack.

**Remaining Issues:**
- Some data needs to be converted to follow semantic conventions for OTEL genai data

---

### Include

**Status:** Merged [Planned 0.4.z]

The `include` parameter allows you to provide a list of flags to include specific categories of additional information in the response payload.
The API now supportes the same fields as the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/create). Llama stack will no
longer raise an HTTP error when these fields are passed, however most of them are not yet implemented. Along with this change,
`message.output_text.logprobs` was implemented fully, allowing you to get logprobs data from your inference server provider.


---

### Max Tool Calls

**Status:** Merged [Planned 0.4.z]

**Issue:** [#3563](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3563)

The Responses API can accept a `max_tool_calls` parameter that limits the number of tool calls allowed to be executed for a given response.

---

### Metadata

**Status:** Merged [Planned 0.4.z]

**Issue:** [#3564](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3564)

Metadata allows you to attach additional information to a response for your own reference and tracking.

---

### Tool Choice

**Status:** Merged [Planned 0.4.z]

**Issue:** [#3548](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3548)

In OpenAI's API, the `tool_choice` parameter allows you to set restrictions or requirements for which tools should be used when generating a response.

---

## Fixed

The following limitations have been addressed in recent releases:

### MCP and Function Tools with No Arguments

**Status:** ✅ Resolved

MCP and function tools now work correctly even when they have no arguments.

---

### `require_approval` Parameter for MCP Tools

**Status:** ✅ Resolved

The `require_approval` parameter for MCP tools in the Responses API now works correctly.

---

### MCP Tools with Array-Type Arguments

**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Fixed in:** [#3003](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/pull/3003) (Agent API), [#3602](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/pull/3602) (Responses API)

MCP tools now correctly handle array-type arguments in both the Agent API and Responses API.

---

### Streaming

**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue:** [#2364](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/2364)

Streaming functionality for the Responses API is feature complete and released.

---

### Prompt Templates

**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue:** [#3321](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3321)

OpenAI's platform supports [templated prompts using a structured language](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?api-mode=responses#reusable-prompts). These templates can be stored server-side for organizational sharing.

---

### Instructions
**Status:**  ✅ Resolved

**Issue:** [#3566](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack/issues/3566)

The Responses API request and response object now supports the *instructions* field.
