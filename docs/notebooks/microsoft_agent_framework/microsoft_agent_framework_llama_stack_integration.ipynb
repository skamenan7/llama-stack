    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **Microsoft Agent Framework** (successor to AutoGen) with **Llama Stack** as the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This notebook uses Microsoft Agent Framework, which replaces AutoGen. For the migration guide, see: [Microsoft Agent Framework Migration Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/migration-guide/from-autogen/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases Covered:\n",
    "1. **Simple ChatAgent** - Single agent task execution\n",
    "2. **Sequential Workflow** - Round-robin multi-agent collaboration\n",
    "3. **AgentThread** - Stateful multi-turn conversations\n",
    "4. **Custom Workflow** - Data-flow with executors and feedback loops\n",
    "5. **Concurrent Workflow** - Parallel agent processing\n",

The framework's pre-built components and support for multiple frameworks reduce development time, allowing developers to focus on other aspects of their project.\n",

      "2. While the benefits of using Llama Stack are mentioned, such as improved model performance and reduced development time, specific examples or case studies that illustrate these benefits would make the content more engaging and concrete for the audience.\n",
      "3. The tone of the blog post is quite formal, which may suit technical decision-makers but could be more approachable for a broader developer audience. Incorporating more conversational language or anecdotes about the challenges of LLM development and how Llama Stack addresses them might enhance readability and appeal.\n"

      "NEEDS REVISION: \n",
      "The code provided has several areas that need improvement. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input Validation**: The `validate_input` function checks if the input email is a string and raises a TypeError if not. However, in the example usage, there's an attempt to call `validate_email(None)`. When this happens, the code does indeed raise an error, but it would be more Pythonic to explicitly check for `None` before calling `validate_input`, since `isinstance(None, str)` is False.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Handling**: The code logs a warning when an IDN is detected but doesn't further validate the domain name according to IDN rules. It would be more robust to actually check if the domain can be encoded in ASCII using Punycode for validation purposes, rather than just logging a warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Error Handling in `validate_email_format`**: This function catches `re.error` exceptions but then immediately raises them again. If the intention is to log the error before re-raising it, this code achieves that. However, if not handling these errors further (e.g., providing a default return value or additional processing), consider removing the try-except block since it does not add any functionality beyond what's already built into Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Logging**: The code uses `logging.error` and `logging.warning` to log various events but does not configure logging anywhere in the provided snippet. Ensure that logging is configured appropriately at the application level, including setting a logging level and handlers for where log messages should be sent (e.g., console, file).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Type Hints for Exception Returns**: While type hints are used for function arguments and return types, consider adding them for raised exceptions as well to make the code's behavior more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Redundant Pattern Matching**: The `validate_email_format` function first checks if an email is non-ASCII before attempting a pattern match with `EMAIL_PATTERN`. However, since `EMAIL_PATTERN` only matches ASCII characters (due to its structure), the check for ASCII can be omitted as it's implicitly required by the regular expression. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Potential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**: Regular expressions are vulnerable to ReDoS when certain patterns cause catastrophic backtracking, leading to exponential time complexity in matching strings. While `EMAIL_PATTERN` seems safe, consider using more efficient validation methods or libraries specifically designed for email address validation if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Comment on Edge Cases**: The code attempts to validate common email formats but notes it might not cover all edge cases according to the official standard (RFC 5322). It would be beneficial to document which specific edge cases this implementation does not handle to set expectations for its usage and limitations. \n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Testing Coverage**: Although there's an example usage with a range of test emails, consider using a unit testing framework like `unittest` to write and run structured tests against the validation functions. This approach ensures more comprehensive coverage of potential inputs and makes it easier to identify regressions if the code is modified in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Consider Using Existing Libraries**: Email address validation can be complex, especially when considering international domain names and all possible valid formats according to RFCs. Consider using an existing library designed specifically for this purpose, like `email-validator`, which might offer more comprehensive and reliable validation capabilities than a custom implementation.\n",

      "**Business Case**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Problem Statement**: The current customer support process is manual, time-consuming, and leads to long wait times, resulting in decreased customer satisfaction.\n",
      "2. **Solution Overview**: Implement a conversational AI-powered chatbot that provides 24/7 support, automates routine inquiries, and directs complex issues to human agents.\n",
      "3. **Key Benefits**:\n",
      "\t* Improved response times (reduced average handle time by 30%)\n",
      "\t* Enhanced customer experience (increased satisfaction ratings by 20%)\n",
      "\t* Reduced support queries (decreased ticket volume by 25%)\n",
      "\t* Cost savings (lowered labor costs by 15%)\n",

      "**Overview**\n",
      "The proposal to deploy a customer service chatbot aims to enhance customer experience, improve response times, and reduce support costs. The chatbot will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to provide automated support for frequently asked questions, routing complex issues to human representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Security Implications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Protection**: The chatbot will collect and process sensitive customer data, including personal identifiable information (PII), payment details, and conversation history. Ensure that the chatbot's data storage and transmission protocols comply with relevant regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS.\n",
      "2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to customer data and ensure that only authorized personnel can modify chatbot configurations or access sensitive...\n",
